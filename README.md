# Dijkstra's Algorithm C++

This is my implementation of Dijkstra's Algoritm in C++. It reads in the graph over STDIN in a list of single space separated edges. Each edge is defined inside [], with 3 comma separated parameters, two nodes and a weight. Vertices must be an uppercase char and weights, an unsigned int.

```example: [A,B,3] [B,C,1] [A,C,7]```

This input above represents the graph shown below:
